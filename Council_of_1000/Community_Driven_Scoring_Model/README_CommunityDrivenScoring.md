# Community-Driven Scoring System for The 1000 Project

## Overview
The wallet scoring system has been updated to reflect community preferences while maintaining the core functionality of incentivizing responsible token holding and wallet behavior.

## Key Adjustments:
1. **Holding Duration** increased to 40% weight, reflecting strong community support for long-term holding.
2. **Balance Stability** weight reduced to 10% to shift more emphasis on holding duration.
3. **Cooldown Compliance** kept at 15%, ensuring fair and progressive penalties.
4. **Transaction Behavior** retained at 15%, promoting low trading frequency.
5. **P2P Transfer Patterns** kept at 10%, penalizing bot-like activity but not affecting genuine users.
6. **Accumulation History** adjusted to 10% to balance long-term holding with organic purchases.

## Final Scoring Breakdown:
| **Metric**                  | **Weight (%)** | **Max Score (out of 1000)** |
|----------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| Holding Duration            | 40%            | 400 pts                      |
| Balance Stability           | 10%            | 100 pts                      |
| Cooldown Compliance         | 15%            | 150 pts                      |
| Transaction Behavior        | 15%            | 150 pts                      |
| P2P Transfer Patterns       | 10%            | 100 pts                      |
| Accumulation History        | 10%            | 100 pts                      |

## Next Steps:
- Test the contract on the testnet.
- Monitor scoring outcomes for various wallet scenarios.
- Gather community feedback post-implementation for further refinements.
