Subject: Full Git Repo Update ðŸš€

Hey Funkaclau,

Iâ€™ve pushed a full repository update to Git. This includes:

.ver2 scripts for incremental updates and change-detection logic.
Modifications to existing parts of the workflow for improved efficiency.
Updated documentation and README for clarity.
Let me know if you encounter any issues or need clarification on the new workflow.

Cheers,
PawPaw
