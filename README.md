## **Overview**

**CommunityShares** is designed to bring real-world utility and governance to the community by enabling decentralized voting and token distribution in a transparent, verifiable way. Built on top of the Shido Network, this project empowers users to participate in governance decisions and receive rewards through a streamlined and scalable process.

Our mission is to create a safer and stronger network by fostering engagement, education, and collaboration.

## **Features**

- **Token-Powered Governance:** Empower community members to vote and make key decisions through token holdings.
- **Transparent Reward Distributions:** Efficient, verifiable token distributions ensure incentives are delivered fairly.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Prefunded wallet configurations allow for batch token transfers to large groups of users.
- **Production-Ready Testing Environment:** Advanced testing setups using mock contracts and dynamic fixtures to ensure robust, bug-free deployments.

## **Current Publicly Available Content**

At this stage of development, the repository contains:

- **Weighted Scoring Module:** A dynamic scoring system influenced by community input. This module is crucial for calculating voting weight and rewards distribution fairly based on token holdings and community contributions.

We’re working to expand the publicly available components in phases as part of our open-source strategy. Please refer to the **[Staggered Open-Source Release Plan](#staggered-open-source-release-plan)** for more details.

## **Staggered Open-Source Release Plan**

We are committed to making CommunityShares a fully open-source and community-governed project over time. To achieve this while balancing security and innovation, we’ve designed a staggered release strategy:

1. **Phase 1: Initial Release (Public Utilities)**
   - Open-source components related to governance voting and token distribution.
   - Provide educational resources to help the community understand and contribute.

2. **Phase 2: Gradual Expansion**
   - Incrementally release internal modules, including prefunded wallet management and mock contract setups.
   - Maintain flexibility to address feedback from early contributors.

3. **Phase 3: Full Open-Source Transition**
   - Open the entire project, including smart contracts and core infrastructure.
   - Transition to full community governance, with key decisions driven by token holders.

This staggered approach allows us to grow safely while fostering innovation and collaboration.
