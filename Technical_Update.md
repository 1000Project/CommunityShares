# 1000 Project - Technical Update Summary

Welcome to the **1000 Project**, where innovation meets sustainable blockchain growth. Over the past development cycle, weâ€™ve achieved significant progress across several key areas, including enhanced project environments, governance models, and long-term utility planning. These updates set the stage for creating lasting value for token holders and community members.

## **Key Progress Highlights**

### **1. Enhanced Development Environment Setup**

Weâ€™ve upgraded our technical foundation to ensure seamless contract development, efficient deployment, and future scalability:

- **Hardhat & Ethers Upgrade:** Updated Hardhat to version 2.22.18 and ethers to version 6.13.5. These updates provide compatibility with the latest plugins, ensuring optimal integration with blockchain tools like Hardhat Toolbox.
- **Clean Dependency Management:** Resolved dependency conflicts by uninstalling outdated packages and cleaning out unused configurations. This reduces potential issues during future upgrades.
- **dotenv Integration:** Added the dotenv package to securely load environment variables such as private keys and RPC URLs, enhancing flexibility for different network deployments.
- **Optimized Deployment Scripts:** Refined deployment scripts to reduce redundancy, ensure smooth integration with ethers v6 syntax, and accelerate contract rollouts across testnets.

### **Why This Matters:**
- Faster deployment with fewer errors during contract launches.
- Increased flexibility to adapt to evolving ecosystem needs.
- Secure and seamless multi-network configurations.
- Improved development efficiency, saving time and resources.

### **2. Community-Driven Weighted Scoring Module**

One of the standout achievements is the design and implementation of the **Weighted Scoring Module**, which was developed with direct community input. This module dynamically calculates voting weight and rewards eligibility based on key factors like holding duration, transaction behavior, and accumulation patterns.

For details, refer to the **[Weighted Scoring Module Documentation](Weighted_Scoring_Proposal/Weighted_Scoring_Module_Documentatin.md)**.

### **Why This Matters:**
- Encourages responsible token holding and organic accumulation.
- Rewards community engagement and long-term participation.
- Introduces dynamic scoring, making the rewards system more fair and scalable.

### **3. Governance and Utility Beyond 1000 Days**

Our roadmap ensures that the 1000 Project continues to grow beyond the initial rewards cycle. Weâ€™ve outlined a plan focused on long-term utility, community governance, and sustainable adoption:

- **On-Chain Utility Expansion:** Continue developing governance modules, batch token transfers, and decentralized tools.
- **DeFi Integration:** Expand $1000 token utility through partnerships with DeFi projects on Shido for staking, lending, and liquidity provision.
- **Staking Program:** Design a staking mechanism to incentivize long-term holding while offering additional rewards.

### **Why This Matters:**
- Establishes long-term token value beyond the initial rewards period.
- Involves the community in shaping the tokenâ€™s future utility.
- Creates a self-sustaining ecosystem with continuous growth opportunities.

### **4. Staggered Open-Source Release Plan**

To balance innovation with security, weâ€™ve adopted a staggered approach to open-sourcing key components of the project:

1. **Phase 1:** Publicly release governance voting and token distribution utilities.
2. **Phase 2:** Gradually release internal modules that enhance functionality, such as prefunded wallet management and mock contract setups for efficient and scalable testing. This phase focuses on practical tools that streamline workflows without overcomplication.
3. **Phase 3:** Transition to full open-source, including smart contracts and core infrastructure.

This staggered approach fosters collaboration while protecting critical innovations.

### **Why This Matters:**
- Builds trust and community engagement through transparency.
- Invites contributions and improvements from the community.
- Ensures a secure transition to a fully open-source and community-governed ecosystem.

## **Next Steps for Immediate Impact**

1. **Testnet Deployment:** Finalize deployments on the Shido Testnet and verify reward mechanisms.
2. **Optimize Gas Usage:** Ensure efficient token transfers and contract interactions.
3. **Prefund Wallets:** Complete the configuration of 20 prefunded wallets for automated batch token transfers.
4. **Early Governance Integration:** Begin implementing community proposals for key decisions.
