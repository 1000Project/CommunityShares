# 1000 Project - Investor Update Summary

Welcome to the **1000 Project**, where innovation meets sustainable blockchain growth. Our work today has laid down essential groundwork for creating a dynamic and scalable ecosystem, focused on long-term value for both token holders and community members.

## **Key Progress Highlights**

### **1. Enhanced Project Environment Setup**

We’ve upgraded our development environment to ensure smooth contract deployment, efficient token distribution, and future scalability:

- **Hardhat & Ethers Upgrade:** Updated Hardhat to version 2.22.18 and ethers to version 6.13.5. These updates provide compatibility with the latest plugins, ensuring optimal integration with blockchain tools like Hardhat Toolbox.
- **Clean Dependency Management:** Resolved dependency conflicts by uninstalling outdated packages and cleaning out unused configurations. This reduces potential issues during future upgrades.
- **dotenv Integration:** Added the dotenv package to securely load environment variables such as private keys and RPC URLs, enhancing flexibility for different network deployments.
- **Automated Setup:** Implemented a smooth transition process between local testing environments and the Shido Testnet.
- **Deployment Script Optimization:** Refined our deployment scripts to reduce redundant calls, ensure smooth integration with the ethers v6 syntax, and support faster contract deployment.

### **How This Benefits Us:**

- Faster deployment and fewer errors during contract rollouts.
- Flexibility to adapt quickly as the ecosystem evolves.
- Enhanced security and seamless multi-network configurations.
- Improved efficiency, saving development time and reducing costs.

### **2. Planned Prefunded Wallet Configuration for Scalable Token Distribution**

We are preparing to configure **20 prefunded wallets** next week, which will enable us to automate batch token transfers. These wallets will be crucial for efficiently distributing rewards, incentives, and supporting community-driven activities.

### **How This Will Benefit Us:**

- Automates reward disbursements across a large network of wallets, saving time and reducing operational overhead.
- Scalable infrastructure to accommodate more wallets as the project grows.

### **3. Simplified Contract Deployment & Testing**

We’ve deployed key contracts, including mock versions of critical components such as our **[MockVRF (Verifiable Random Function)](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/introduction/) (click to learn more)** and **RewardBurnWalletMockVRF**. The MockVRF simulates the randomness provided by external systems like Chainlink, allowing us to proceed with internal development and testing without delays. This strategic approach enables the seamless development of reward distribution mechanisms by decoupling external dependencies and ensuring internal progress.

Additionally, we’ve implemented **[fixtures](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestFixture.html) (click to learn more)** to provide clean and isolated environments for each test. By caching deployment states, our fixtures optimize the testing process, reduce redundant contract deployments, and guarantee reliable test outcomes.

### **Why Fixtures Matter:**

- **Consistency:** Every test starts with the same environment, eliminating cross-test contamination.
- **Efficiency:** By caching deployment states, we reduce setup time while ensuring clean blockchain resets between tests.
- **Real-World Scenarios:** Fixtures allow us to simulate different wallet states and token distributions, making tests more relevant to production conditions.

### **How This Benefits Us:**

- Allows rigorous testing of reward mechanisms and governance logic before deploying them on the mainnet.
- Minimizes the risk of bugs or inefficiencies affecting production.
- Ensures faster, reliable testing cycles that improve overall project development speed.

### **4. Clear and Actionable Documentation**

We revamped the project’s documentation, making it easy for investors and developers alike to understand the project’s goals, progress, and community engagement strategies.

### **How This Benefits Us:**

- Keeps investors informed of key milestones and progress.
- Provides developers with a clear roadmap to maintain smooth project development.

## **Next Steps for Immediate Impact**

1. **Testnet Deployment:** Fund our test wallets and deploy contracts on the Shido Testnet.
2. **Optimize Gas Usage:** Ensure token transfers and reward distributions are gas-efficient.
3. **Finalize Mainnet Readiness:** Prepare configurations for the full mainnet launch.
4. **Prefund Wallets:** Complete the configuration of 20 prefunded wallets for batch token transfers.
