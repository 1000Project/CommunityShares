## **How the Scoring Model Works**

Our scoring model is designed to incentivize responsible holding behavior while promoting fairness and sustainability. Wallets are evaluated using the following criteria:

| **Metric**                  | **Weight (%)** | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Holding Duration            | 40%            | Rewards long-term commitment with higher scores for extended token holding.    |
| Balance Stability           | 10%            | Considers wallets with low volatility as more stable and reliable.              |
| Cooldown Compliance         | 15%            | Ensures wallets follow cooldown rules to prevent frequent trading violations.   |
| Transaction Behavior        | 15%            | Rewards wallets with low trading frequency, promoting HODLing.                 |
| P2P Transfer Patterns       | 10%            | Identifies and penalizes bot-like or suspicious P2P transfers.                  |
| Accumulation History        | 10%            | Encourages organic token accumulation through multiple strategic purchases.    |

## **How to Optimize Your Wallet**

To maximize your rewards and ensure qualification, follow these best practices:

- **HODL your tokens:** Wallets with long holding durations earn higher scores. Avoid frequent trades to maintain a stable score.
- **Follow cooldown rules:** Ensure you don’t trigger cooldown violations by making excessive transactions within short timeframes.
- **Avoid bot-like P2P transfers:** Only engage in genuine peer-to-peer transactions to avoid penalties.
- **Accumulate strategically:** Build your holdings gradually to benefit from positive accumulation scores.
